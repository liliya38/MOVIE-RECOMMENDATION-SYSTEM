# MOVIE-RECOMMENDATION-SYSTEM
Recommendation Systems are a type of information filtering systems as they improve the quality of search results and provides items that are more relevant to the search item or are realted to the search history of the user.

Application:-
Amazon uses it to suggest products to customers. 
YouTube uses it to decide which video to play next on autoplay. 
Facebook uses it to recommend pages to like and people to follow. 
Moreover, companies like Netflix and Spotify depend highly on the effectiveness of their recommendation engines for their business and success.

A movie recommendation system, or a movie recommender system, is an ML-based approach to filtering or predicting the users' film preferences based on their past choices and behavior.

## Types of Recommendation System
